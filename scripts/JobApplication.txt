Hey everyone, in this video we're going to take a look at a smart contract written 
in Solidity called JobApplication. This contract is designed to handle job applications 
submitted by users on a blockchain network.

Let's start by looking at the variables defined in the contract. There are several 
private mappings that store application data: 

- The `applications` mapping is used to store applications by their unique identifier
- The `jobApplications` mapping is used to store applications associated with a specific job
- The `userApplications` mapping is used to store applications submitted by a specific user

There's also a private counter variable called `applicationCounter` that keeps track 
of the total number of applications.

Now let's take a closer look at the functions in this contract.

The `submitApplication` function allows users to submit a new job application. It 
takes in two parameters: `uint _jobId` which is the ID of the job the user is applying 
for, and `string memory _coverLetter` which is the cover letter submitted by the user. 

Inside the function, a new `Application` struct is created with the relevant data, 
and then stored in the `applications` mapping. The `jobApplications` and `userApplications` 
mappings are also updated with the new application's ID. Finally, an event called 
`ApplicationSubmitted` is emitted to notify other nodes on the network that a new 
application has been submitted.

The `withdrawApplication` function allows users to withdraw an application they've 
submitted. It takes in one parameter: `uint _applicationId` which is the ID of the 
application the user wants to withdraw.

Inside the function, the application with the given ID is retrieved from the `applications` 
mapping. The function then checks that the applicant attempting to withdraw the 
application is the same as the applicant who originally submitted it. It also checks 
that the application has not already been withdrawn. If both of these conditions 
are met, the application's `isWithdrawn` field is set to `true`, and an event called 
`ApplicationWithdrawn` is emitted to notify other nodes on the network.

The `getApplication` function allows users to retrieve details about a specific 
job application. It takes in one parameter: `uint _applicationId` which is the ID 
of the application the user wants to retrieve.

Inside the function, the application with the given ID is retrieved from the `applications`
mapping and returned to the user.

The `getApplicationsByJob` function allows users to retrieve all job applications 
associated with a specific job. It takes in one parameter: `uint _jobId` which is 
the ID of the job the user is interested in.

Inside the function, the `jobApplications` mapping is used to retrieve an array 
of application IDs associated with the given job ID. The function then iterates 
over this array and retrieves each corresponding `Application` struct from the `applications` 
mapping. Finally, an array of all the retrieved `Application` structs is returned 
to the user.

The `getApplicationsByUser` function allows users to retrieve all job applications 
they've submitted. It takes in one parameter: `address _applicant` which is the 
address of the user who submitted the applications.

Inside the function, the `userApplications` mapping is used to retrieve an array 
of application IDs submitted by the given user. The function then iterates over 
this array and retrieves each corresponding `Application` struct from the `applications` 
mapping. Finally, an array of all the retrieved `Application` structs is returned 
to the user.

And that's a quick overview of the JobApplication smart contract! This contract 
provides a simple and efficient way for users to submit job applications and for 
employers to manage and track those applications. The contract uses a series of 
mappings to store applications by their ID, the job they are associated with, 
and the user who submitted them. It also includes functions for submitting, 
withdrawing, and retrieving applications, as well as emitting events for each of 
those actions.
